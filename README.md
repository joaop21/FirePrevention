# FirePrevention
Deterministic Methods of Operational Research project in OPL

This project was carried out in the first semester of the third year of informatics engineering course at University of Minho. [2018-2019]

the main purpose of this project was to calculate in what places the fire passed and how long it took to reach a certain locality. The localities were organized in a structured graph.

This project was developed by me and my colleagues, respectively:
